> We are [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim's]] heirs–and still ahve ahead of us the task he accorded us: to create new ways of belonging, to take some of the pressure off of the individual, to find a correct balance between freedom and solidarity, and to generate ideologies that allow us not to take our own failures so personally and sometimes so tragically.

From [["Émile Durkheim"]]
