> If you'll investigate the history of science, my dear boy, I think you'll find that most of the really big ideas have come from intelligent playfulness. All the sober, thin-lipped concentration is really just a matter of tidying up around the fringes of the big ideas.

— Dr. Gorman Tarbell, fictional scientist in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s short story [[Media/Written/Short Stories/Armageddon in Retrospect|Armageddon in Retrospect]].
