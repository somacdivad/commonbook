> The dream of catching a unicorn ran through the drab fabric of the lives of the father and son like a golden thread.

> Both knew there were no unicorns in England. But they'd agreed to madness–to live as though there were unicorns around; as though Ethelbert were going to catch one any day; as though the scrawny family would soon be stuffing itself with meat, selling the horn for a fortune living happily ever after.

From [["The Unicorn Trap"]]
